Instead, the query returned information logs from the checkout service.\n\n## Query Details:\n- PPL Query: `source\u003dss4o_logs-otel-2025.08.05&#124; where log.attributes.severity \u003e\u003d \u0027ERROR\u0027 and time \u003e\u003d CURDATE()`\n- Result: 86 log entries returned, but all are INFO level logs (not errors)\n\n## Log Entries Summary:\nAll returned logs share the following characteristics:\n- **Log Level**: All logs have severity \"info\" (not ERROR as requested)\n- **Service**: All logs are from the \"checkout\" service\n- **Message Pattern**: All logs contain the same message: \"client/metadata fetching metadata for all topics from broker kafka:9092\"\n- **Timestamps**: Logs span throughout the day (August 5, 2025) at 10-minute intervals\n\n## Observations:\n1. No actual error logs were found for today in the `ss4o_logs-otel-2025.08.05` index\n2. The checkout service appears to be logging connection attempts to Kafka every 10 minutes\n3. These are routine informational logs, not errors\n4. The query may need refinement to correctly filter for error logs (e.g., examining if the severity field is stored differently)\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere appear to be no error logs in the system for today (August 5, 2025), at least not in the format or severity level we\u0027re querying for. All observed logs are routine Kafka connection attempts from the checkout service."
